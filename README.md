# CureCSharp
A simple C# CURE algorithm implementation.

It works on a randomly generated dataset of "shopping bags" that contain several products (strings) chosen from a larger set of producs.
Clusteroids are chosen as "average" bags, i.e. a set of pairs (producs â€” it's average presence in the cluster's bags ranged 0.0 -1.0).
